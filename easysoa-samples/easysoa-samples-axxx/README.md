AXXX Use Case

See introduction at https://github.com/easysoa/EasySOA/wiki/Axxx-use-case 

The AXXX scenario is meant to be played like this :
* 1. model Specifications in registry
* 1.1 auto fill registry by RemoteRepositoryInit (afterwards you can show a little bit how to work on Specifications)
* 1.2 have a look at dashboard(s)
* 1.3 approval workflow : see changes & publish
* 2. develop Realisation
* 2.1 do code disco in AXXX projects by 'mvn clean install' (afterwards you can show a little bit how to work on code)
* 1.2 have a look at dashboard(s)
* 3. deploy
* 3.1 by starting AXXX applications or mocks
* 3.2 do web disco

TODO : (AXXX impl,) web disco, monitored messages disco, environments & mock vs actual impl, publish impl & depl, CIO dashboard, integrated platforms (Jasmine SOA monitoring, FStudio call & mocking, Talend service development)

Additional samples :
in rest-server, DashboardMatchingSamples fills registry with data that helps showcase matching
