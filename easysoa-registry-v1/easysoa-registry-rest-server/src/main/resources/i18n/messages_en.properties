sourceDiscovery.doc=Sources Discovery allows to automatically extract known services, implementations \
and consumptions from source code (for now, Java) by analyzing it at compilation time.
webDiscovery.doc=Find any useful service from your intranet, or even the web: as you browse pages, \
informations on services are collected and sent the registry.
runtimeDiscovery.doc=Automatic discovery of web services by listening exchanges between applications.
serviceBrowsing.doc=EasySOA provides an example of a simple "service portal" web user interface. It \
lists all services, allows to browse them by tags (a.k.a. TaggingFolder) and also to tag them. For \
each service, an example of a dedicated "service usage" documentation page can be displayed.

matchingDashboard.doc=EasySOA Registry's Matching Dashboard lists all discovered SOA elements \
(implementations and endpoints) that its automatic matching algorithm couldn't link with the \
existing SOA model because of lack of information that could help it decide one way or the other, \
and further helps the SOA administrator link them by providing suggestions along the specified \
architecture (Components).

soapui.doc=<a href="http://www.soapui.org/">SOAPUI</a> allows to call and simulate SOAP or \
REST services that have a formal definition. EasySOA generates SOAPUI configuration files \
that are complete and consistent, meaning with all deployed services (endpoints) of a \
given environment of a given project and no other. This prevents for instance erroneously \
sending test data in production.
scaffolderProxy.doc=The Scaffolder Proxy tool generates HTML forms from WSDL files, allowing \
then to send requests using specified parameters.
proxyRunManager.doc=Proxy Run Management UI, allowing to start, stop and record "runs". A "run" \
is a list of request / responses that have been recorded by the EasySOA HTTP Proxy.
frascatiStudio.doc=Online development studio allowing to create and deploy SCA applications \
on OW2 FraSCAti SCA runtime platform.
easysoaRestApi.doc=REST API allowing to remotely talk to EasySOA.
